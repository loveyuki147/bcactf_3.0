# A Fine Line
175 points - By Marvin

Tag: crypto

I'm carefully drawing a fine line on this piece of paper, letting each portion guide the next... (Digits and letters are 0-9 and 10-35 in their usual orders, and the underscore is 36. {} are not encoded but should be added in afterwards. All letters are lowercase.)

## Hint
- This uses the affine cipher, as clued by the title and description, but with an added modification.
- Each pair of letters decodes the next.
