This time, we support THREE colors! And we've reduced the file size by using raw binary. (Though, with caveats that it's hard to read with a text editor or edit manually, and that the maximum file size is 256x256.)

## Hint
- The resolution is now represented in just two bytes.
- The pixels now require ternary to represent three colors.
- Remember, the ternary's been converted to raw binary.
