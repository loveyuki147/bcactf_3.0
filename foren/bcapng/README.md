BCACTF's latest creation: an image file format! It can represent black and white pixels, and isn't too efficient. The problem is, someone sent me a .bcapng file and I lost the program to view it. Could you tell me what it is?

[chall.bcapng](chall.bcapng)

## Hint
- What do the first two numbers in the file represent?
- bcapng files can only represent black or white pixels

## Write up
