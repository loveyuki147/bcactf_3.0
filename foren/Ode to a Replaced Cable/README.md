# Ode to a Replaced Cable

I just spent a bunch of money on an amazing piano keyboard, but I didn't realize I can't connect it directly to my PC! I then spent a bunch more money on an audio interface, but there was this STUPID ANNOYING BUZZING SOUND whenever I recorded something. I then spent even more money on a cable to replace it (actually only $6.60, it was on sale!) and now there's barely any buzzing left!

With this new equipment, I wrote a song to my friend in France. He doesn't speak English, but they say music is a universal language, so we jam together sometimes! Also, don't try to analyze the buzzing sound. It's genuinely not supposed to be there, and it's not a part of the problem. Actually, if you do know what's causing it, please DM me. I'm pretty desperate at this point. Anyways, I hope you like the song!

## Hint
- Seriously, the buzzing isn't part of the problem. Stop trying to analyze it.
- I mean it, there's actually nothing to analyze with the buzzing.
- STOP ANALYZING THE BUZZING
- I really hope that saying about music being a universal language is true! Because I have no intention to learn French.
- Consider various ways of describing the music in hint.mp3...
